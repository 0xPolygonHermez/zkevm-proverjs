# zkEVM ProverJS
zkEVM proof generator reference written in Javascript

## General info

## setup
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

## Usage
Basic usage:
```sh
$ node src/main_executor <input.json> -r <rom.json> -o <proof.json>
```
Example:
```sh
$ node src/main_executor testvectors/input_executor.json -r ../zkrom/build/rom.json -o tmp/commit.bin
```
Additional parameters:

- `-t <test.json>`: test
- `-l <logs.json>`: logs
- `-s`: skip
- `-d`: debug
- `-p`: pilprogram.pil
- `-P`: pilConfig.json
- `-n <number>`: N

### Build prove
```sh
npm run buildall
```
### Build prove with basic main (without SM, only for debugging)
```sh
npm run buildall --pil=pil/basic_main.pil --starkstruct=debug
```
### Build prove with pilconfig (only for debugging)
```sh
npm run buildall --pilconfig=testvectors/pilconfig.pil --starkstruct=debug
```
### Build options
**from**: syntax is --from=\<step\> to indicate step where start build/rebuild
```sh
npm run buildall --from=c12setup
```
**continue**: this option hasn't additional argument. With this option buildall detected last step well done and continues from next step.
```sh
npm run buildall --continue
```
**pil**: syntax is --pil=\<main.pil\> where main.pil was name of pil to compile. For debugging could use basic_main.pil. See --starkstruct option
```sh
npm run buildall --pil=pil/basic_main.pil --starkstruct=debug
```
**pilconfig**: syntax is --pilconfig=<pilconfig.json> where pilconfig.json was name of config used in pil compilation. See --starkstruct option
```sh
npm run buildall --pilconfig=testvectors/pilconfig.json --starkstruct=debug
```
**starkstruct**: syntax is --startstruct=debug to generates automatic starkstruct adapted to pil bits number. Only for debugging. This option shall used with --pil or pilconfig if number of bits change.
```sh
npm run buildall --starkstruct=debug
```
**build**: with this option could change build directory, by default build directory is build/proof.
```sh
npm run buildall --build=build/basic_proof
```
**input**: with this option indicates input file to use.
```sh
npm run buildall --input=test/myinputfile.json
```
